The following options were used to configure sudo for Debian GNU/Linux.

  --with-exempt=sudo 

	Any user in group 'sudo' will not need to type their password.  It
	is strongly recommended that no users be put in group sudo, and that
	instead the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file be used if desired.

  --with-pam 
	
	Support for pluggable authentication modules.

  --with-fqdn 

	Allow use of fully qualified domain names in the sudoers file.

  --disable-root-mailer

	Send mail as the invoking user, not as root.

  --with-logging=syslog
  --with-logfac=authpriv 

	Where logging information goes.

  --with-env-editor 
  --with-editor=/usr/bin/editor 

	Honor the EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables.  If they are not
	present, default to the Debian default system editor.

  --with-timeout=15 
  --with-password-timeout=0 

	Allow 15 minutes before a user has to re-type their passord, versus
	the sudo usual default of 5.  Never time out while waiting for a
	password to be typed, this is a seriously big deal for Debian package
	developers using 'dpkg-buildpackage -rsudo'.

  --with-secure-path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:\
	/sbin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin"  

	Give a reasonable default path for commands run as root via sudo.

  --with-all-insults

	Include all the insults in the binary, won't be enabled unless turned
	on in the sudoers file.
