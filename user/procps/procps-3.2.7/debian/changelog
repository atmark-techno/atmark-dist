  * This is an experimental release of the procps suite. A lot of features have

     - support for both BSD and POSIX (SVR4) style command line options.
     - completely configurable display of information.
     - colour markup of processes exceeding limits or belonging to a user.
    Please take a look at /usr/doc/procps/NEWS and the manpages for a concise
    list. This is how the next upstream release of procps may look
    (i.e. it will  look like this if there is not too much resistance).
